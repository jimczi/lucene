 * {@link DocScoreHeap} that keeps the doc id as a real {@code long}, in a parallel array next to the
 * scores. Used when the reader's doc-id space exceeds {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} and the doc no longer
 * fits alongside the score in a single {@code long} (see {@link PackedDocScoreHeap}).
 *
 * <p>Modeled on {@code TernaryLongHeap}: 1-based indexing (slot 0 unused) and 3-ary fan-out. The
 * sift-down compares scores and consults the doc array only to break an exact score tie, so its hot
