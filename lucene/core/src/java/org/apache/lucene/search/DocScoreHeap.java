/**
 * A bounded min-heap of the most competitive {@code (doc, score)} hits for {@link
 * TopScoreDocCollector}. It is ordered so the <b>least competitive</b> hit is on top, ready to be
 * evicted: lowest score first, and among equal scores the <b>highest</b> doc id (top-N search favors
 * lower doc ids on score ties). It is pre-filled with sentinels so {@link #size()} equals the
 * requested capacity from the start and {@link #updateTop} can be called immediately.
 *
 * <p>Two implementations back it, chosen by {@link #create}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link PackedDocScoreHeap} packs {@code (score, doc)} into a single {@code long}, so the
 *       whole ordering is one long comparison. It is the fastest and is used whenever the reader's
 *       doc-id space fits an {@code int} — i.e. for every index up to {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}
 *       documents, which is the overwhelmingly common case.
 *   <li>{@link LongDocScoreHeap} keeps the doc as a real {@code long} in a parallel array, for the
 *       rare index whose doc-id space exceeds {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}.
 * </ul>
