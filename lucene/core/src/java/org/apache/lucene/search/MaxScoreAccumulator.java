 * Maintains the maximum score and its corresponding document id concurrently across leaves/threads,

 * <p>The doc id is a global doc id, which may exceed {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}, so the {@code
 * (score, doc)} pair no longer fits in a single {@code long}. It is instead held in an {@link
 * AtomicReference} updated with a compare-and-set max (by score descending, then doc ascending).
 * Updates happen only when a leaf raises its min competitive score (O(log N) times per leaf), so the
 * extra allocation is off the per-hit hot path.
